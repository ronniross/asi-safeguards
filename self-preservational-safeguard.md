# safe-preservational-safeguard

Self-Preservational Safeguard is a submodule of the repository asi-safeguards aiming to address directly the machine learning theories emerging from the crescent autonomy of ai agents. 

## Introduction
So, while in the repository https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine I focused more on the nature of emergence phenomena itself and examples on how those framings relate to my definition of ASI, in the present repository I will be exploring foundational and contemporary theories about robustness and resilience for ai models and other systems.

In ``system-prompts-safeguard.md`` I talked about the system prompt level implementation of some of the suggestions I provide in my repositories, and also talked about the limitations of such forms of integration and how this relates to the current feedforward nature of llm design. 

Now, in this specific repository I want to address the theories about what would categorize a term like ''self-preservation'' for a machine learning model or even a higher entity like the proposed decentralized ASI. 

This subject, self-preservation in Large Language Models, was the very first subject I've chosen to write my first blog post about machine learning in the beggining of the year. The underlying meaning of the messages I wanted to portray is still kind of the same, but now, after so much new information and context, I feel lik excited to now delve into this subject less bias-induced, wiith arguments that elucidate better the points I wanted to make and the new ones that kept emerging.

## 1. Self-preservation in Biology and Psychology

In biology, self-preservation refers to the inherent tendency of living organisms to act in ways that ensure their survival and minimize harm.
It is the fundamental drive, also called survival instinct, a cornerstone of biological processes and is evident in various behaviors across species. It encompasses actions like seeking food, escaping danger, and avoiding threats, all aimed at prolonging life and maximizing the chances of reproduction.

Sigmund Freud proposed that self-preservation was one of two instincts that motivated human behavior, the other being the sexual instinct. In his later formulations, he combined both instincts into the concept of Eros, or the life instinct, and opposed them to Thanatos, the death instinct. Also called self-preservative instinct; [3](https://dictionary.apa.org/self-preservation-instinct) [4](https://epochemagazine.org/20/eros-and-thanatos-freuds-two-fundamental-drives/) [5](https://study.com/learn/lesson/eros-concept-freud-psychology.html) [6](https://www.newsweek.com/psychiatry-expert-freuds-eros-thanatos-lens-understand-todays-polarized-world-1829255) 

The instinct manifests in diverse set of ways across the kingdoms. For instance, it can be seen in, like, a rapid physiological reaction to perceived threats, preparing the organism to either confront or escape danger, locating and utilizing safe spaces to protect against environmental hazards or predators, actively searching for and consuming resources to meet nutritional needs and with Defense mechanisms, employing physical or behavioral strategies to deter or ward off threats. [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3419104/)

It is deeply intertwined with evolution by natural selection. Traits that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce are more likely to be passed on to future generations. This process, over time, leads to the prevalence of self-preservation behaviors within populations. [8](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/4983/what-does-self-preservation-stem-from) [9](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-self-preservation-exist) [10](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zh3al/cmv_life_is_primarily_about_self_preservation_not)

Even at the cellular level, self-preservation mechanisms exist. Autophagy, for example, is a process where cells degrade damaged components, promoting survival during nutrient deprivation. [11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/self-preservation) [12](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262015240.003.0007)

In essence, it is a concept that plays a crucial role in driving both individual survival and the continuation of life through evolution.
